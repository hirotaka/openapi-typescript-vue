# openapi-typescript-vue

Tools for consuming OpenAPI schemas in TypeScript, with Vue.js support.

This project provides Vue.js-specific packages that complement the [openapi-typescript](https://github.com/openapi-ts/openapi-typescript) ecosystem.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This project is currently in development and has known issues with internal TypeScript type errors. While the functionality works as expected, there are unresolved type issues that may cause TypeScript compilation warnings or errors.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended for production use at this time.**

### Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Functionality**: All features work correctly at runtime
- ‚ùå **TypeScript Types**: Internal type errors need to be resolved
- üîß **Development**: Suitable for experimentation and development
- üö´ **Production**: Not recommended until type issues are fixed

### Help Wanted
